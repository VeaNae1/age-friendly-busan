# age-friendly-busan

## What is this?
An age-friendly city is a city where anyone can actively participate in society so that they can have a vibrant and healthy old age in a city where they do not feel uncomfortable getting older, a city where anyone can live regardless of age, or a city where they want to live for life.

### Why we need this?
1. rapid population aging
  ● According to future population estimates, the elderly population is expected to enter a super-aged society in 2022 with a population aged 65 or older exceeding 20%.
  ● The low proportion of the working-age population and the high proportion of the elderly population are disadvantageous due to the relatively high support cost and aging index.

2. Full-scale retirement of baby boomers and preparation for the increase in the elderly population
  ● The proportion of the population of baby boomers from 1955 to 1963 also exceeded the national average by 14.6%, so it is urgent to prepare a support system for them.

3. Need for welfare programs for the elderly that all citizens experience.
  ●  The budget for welfare for the elderly continues to increase, but problems such as poverty for the elderly, care, and lack of leisure space continue to emerge in relation to the aging of the population.
